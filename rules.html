            <p> <strong>Rules</strong><br>the game is supposed to be fun, and you want the unwrapping ceremony to be
                funny. <br> If everybody is receiving a tin of Quality Street or a £10 voucher for Next, then sure, it’s
                nice – but it would also suggest that there isn’t much morale or team bonding going on in your office.
                <br> When choosing a funny gift, keep the joke simple, and ideally one that makes sense to everyone –
                especially the recipient. <br> The last thing you want to do is offend or confuse someone, so if you’re
                going for a more risqué approach, judge your work environment and be sure that people will find it
                funny. If you’re going to get your boss a copy of 'Management for Dummies', then you’d better be sure
                that they have a sense of humour!</p>
